- Demonstration of a singly linked list (with only head)
    + AwsmNode class
    + AwsmLinkedList class
    + AwsmLinkedListIterator class. Emphasize difference between this iterator and the AwsmArrayListIterator iterator: the arraylist one takes in the entire list, this one only takes in a node since that's all we need
    + Refactoring all of them into a single class
- Singly linked list with head AND tail allowing for O(1) addLast
- Sketch of doubly linked list
